0ddpgp installation readme:

0ddpgp has a few prerequisites, if you don't have them, the installation script will tell you.


To run the installation script, enter the following command:

sudo ./0ddPGP_installation.sh

The installation script needs to run as root which is why the command sudos. The installation involves folders that require root permissions.

I'm pretty sure I've dummy proofed this, but that was the famous last words of my programming teacher so if you run into any problems, tell the developer 0dd3ye

After it runs, it will give you instructions. If it gives you errors, something is wrong. After reading the instructions, read the new README in the new 0ddpgp folder at /usr/lib/0ddPGP/README.
